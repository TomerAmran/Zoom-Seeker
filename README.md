# Zoom-Seeker
This is a simple app that adds three control features to Zoom recorded seasons.
    
    1) pause/play by hitting 'space' key or 'p' key
    
    2) Seek forward and backward by pressing Right and Left on your keyboard.
    
    3) Change playback-speed by pressing Shift+'>'/'<'

The extension adds some EventListeners to the DOM and adds one div-element for visual feedback.
